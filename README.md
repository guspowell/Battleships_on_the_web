## Technologies Used

- Ruby
- LANGUAGE_TWO
- Sinatra
- Cucumber & RSpec

## Job List

- I recently started this project again, so it is long way of completion. I hope to revisit this at some point.

## Collaborators

- Gus Powell (http://www.github.com/guspowell)

## Takeaway

I now have a solid understanding of Sinatra, including routes and servers.
